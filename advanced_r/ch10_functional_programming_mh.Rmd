# [Chapter 10: Functional Programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html)

1. Functional = Take function as an argument 

2. "Anonymous function" which I knew after experience but never thought of as a concept

Exercises
```{r}
cv_list <- lapply(mtcars, function(x) sd(x)/mean(x)*100)
```
